# 007 Xamarin Android Application

This project was undertaken as part of a weekend assignment to independently explore a technology in which I had no previous experience. I chose to build a simple Xamarin Android application to view info found on the Restful 007 Movie API. 





##### This project was built during Week 8 of the immersive back-end engineering course at The Iron Yard, Greenville, SC.
